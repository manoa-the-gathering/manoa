<div class="active content">
	There are many terms you'll need to become fluent with in order to make sense of the many interactions and aspects of Magic.
	<div class="accordion">

		<!--//////// Permanents ////////////////////////-->
		<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
			Permanent
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			A card which stays on the battlefield for more than one phase of a turn. Generally includes Lands, Creatures, Artifacts, and Enchantments.
		</div>

		<!--//////// State Based Actions ////////////////-->
		<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
			State-based action (SBA)
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			An effect which triggers due to the moment-by-moment state of the board. These are instantaneous actions not taken by either player, but rather by the rules themselves. For example, if at any point your life total is equal to or less than 0, you lose the game as an SBA. If your creature’s toughness equals or is less than 0, it dies as an SBA. If you enter your Draw phase, you take a card from the top of your library and place it in your hand, as an SBA. These are things which cannot be interacted with, changed, or interrupted by any means after they have started.

		<!--//////// Zones //////////////////////////////-->
		<div class="active title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
			Zones
		</div>
		<div class="active content">
			<p>A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Each player has his or her own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players. I have included an informal diagram courtesy of Loading Ready Run.</p>

			<div class="accordion">
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Library (The Pile)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Your deck begins play in this zone, shuffled and face down. If you would draw a card from your library, but there are no cards in this zone, you lose the game. (This is called “being milled out”. The library represents your store of knowledge, or your mind.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Hand</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Like a normal hand of cards, these are the cards you currently have access to and which you are always holding while you are at the table. You will start the game with a hand of 7 cards from the top of your library, cast spells from your hand to the battlefield, and replace them by drawing from the top of (or searching) your library.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Battlefield (Fighty Place, Dudes, Lands & Junk)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Permanents stay here, facing you. When you cast a creature spell and it resolves, put it into Dudes. New Dudes enter on your right. When you attack with a creature, move it into the Fighty Place. When you play a land, artifact (which is not also a creature), or enchantment, place it in Lands & Junk.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Graveyard (Dead Stuff)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>When a creature is killed, or a spell resolves (or is countered, or fizzles), or an enchantment or artifact is destroyed, move it to the yard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Stack</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Cards which have been cast, but not yet resolved. When you cast a spell, put it onto the top of the stack. Now, you may either retain priority (in which case you may be the first to cast instants and activate abilities) or give priority to your opponent. If you retain, you must give priority after. There is no way to deny priority to your opponent completely. If they decide to respond, they may cast instants and activate abilities, any of which may or may not affect your spell. Items on the stack will be resolved in reverse order, just like a programming stack (last in, first out).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i>
					<p>Exile (Really, Really Dead Stuff)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Sometimes, an effect will say to exile a card. This effectively removes it from the game. Only a very few cards are able to bring other cards back from exile, and none of them are present in Manoa. If a card goes here, it is not coming back.</p>

			<p>CMC</p>

			<p>Converted mana cost. How many mana it takes to activate the spell.</p>
